## Architecture Highlights

### Unified Customer System
```typescript
// Single customer model used everywhere
interface UnifiedCustomer {
  id: string;
  phone: string;
  email?: string;
  platforms: {
    punchCard: boolean;
    transportation: boolean;
    hotel: boolean;
    events: boolean;
  };
  totalPoints: number;
  tier: 'bronze' | 'silver' | 'gold' | 'platinum';
}
```

### Platform Adapters
```typescript
// Easy to add new platforms
class PlatformAdapterFactory {
  adapters = {
    punchCard: new PunchCardAdapter(),
    transportation: new TransportationAdapter(),
    hotel: new HotelAdapter(),
    events: new EventAdapter(),
    // Future: delivery: new DeliveryAdapter()
  };
}
```

### Cross-Platform Rewards
```typescript
// Rewards that span multiple platforms
const crossPlatformRewards = [
  {
    id: 'coffee-commuter',
    name: 'Coffee Commuter Reward',
    requirements: {
      punchCard: { coffeeShopVisits: 10 },
      transportation: { ferryRides: 5 }
    },
    reward: 'Free ferry ticket + Free coffee'
  }
];
```

### Phone-less Access System
```typescript
// Extended customer profile with proxy access
interface CustomerProfile extends UnifiedCustomer {
  proxyAccess: {
    enabled: boolean;
    pin?: string; // 4-digit PIN for phone-less transactions
    authorizedUsers: Array<{
      name: string;
      relationship: 'child' | 'spouse' | 'caregiver' | 'other';
      photo?: string; // Base64 encoded photo for verification
    }>;
    printableCardUrl?: string; // URL to generate physical card
  };
}

// Proxy validation in business app
async function validateProxyPunch(
  customerPhone: string,
  validationMethod: 'pin' | 'card' | 'trusted',
  validationData?: string,
  proxyDetails?: {
    name: string;
    staffId: string;
  }
): Promise<ValidationResult> {
  // Multi-layer validation logic
  const customer = await getCustomerByPhone(customerPhone);
  
  if (!customer.proxyAccess.enabled) {
    return { success: false, reason: 'Proxy access not enabled' };
  }
  
  // Validate based on method
  switch (validationMethod) {
    case 'pin':
      return validatePIN(customer, validationData);
    case 'card':
      return validatePhysicalCard(customer, validationData);
    case 'trusted':
      return validateTrustedTransaction(customer, proxyDetails);
  }
  
  // Log all proxy transactions for audit
  await logProxyTransaction({
    customerId: customer.id,
    method: validationMethod,
    proxyDetails,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
  
  // Send notification to primary account holder
  await sendProxyNotification(customer, proxyDetails);
}
```

### Implementation Details for Phone-less Access

#### 1. **Physical Card Generation**
- Generate printable PDF with QR code and customer info
- Include visual security features (watermark, hologram effect)
- Support multiple card designs for different occasions
- Card contains encrypted identifier, not personal data

#### 2. **Family Account Management**
- Primary account holder can add/remove authorized users
- Set individual permissions per family member
- Optional photo upload for visual verification
- Age-appropriate restrictions (e.g., no alcohol rewards for minors)

#### 3. **PIN System Implementation**
- Optional 4-digit PIN setup in customer app
- PIN + phone number allows phone-less punch collection
- Failed PIN attempts trigger security notifications
- PIN can be reset via app with authentication

#### 4. **Business Trust System**
- Businesses can flag regular customers as "trusted"
- Verbal confirmation sufficient for trusted accounts
- All trust-based transactions require staff authorization
- Monthly audit reports for trust-based transactions

#### 5. **Security & Audit Trail**
- All proxy transactions logged with full details
- Real-time notifications to primary account holder
- Daily/weekly summary emails of proxy activities
- Ability to review and dispute proxy transactions

### Use Case Example: Child Buying Coffee for Grandmother

**Scenario**: 10-year-old Sarah regularly buys coffee for her grandmother Mary (phone: 555-1234)

**Solution Options**:

1. **Physical Card Method**:
   - Grandmother prints a proxy card from the app with her QR code
   - Card shows: "Proxy Card for Mary's Account - Authorized User: Sarah (Granddaughter)"
   - Sarah shows the card to the barista who scans it
   - Punch is added, grandmother receives notification

2. **PIN Method**:
   - Sarah tells barista: "I'm collecting a punch for 555-1234"
   - Barista enters phone number in their app
   - Sarah provides the 4-digit PIN (e.g., 1985)
   - System validates and adds punch
   - Grandmother receives: "Sarah just collected a punch at Coffee House"

3. **Trusted Customer Method**:
   - Coffee shop recognizes Sarah as Mary's granddaughter
   - Business has marked Mary's account as "Family Trusted"
   - Barista manually approves the punch with note: "Sarah - granddaughter"
   - Transaction logged with staff member's ID

**Customer App Features**:
- "Manage Family Access" section in settings
- Generate and print proxy cards
- Set/change PIN
- View proxy transaction history
- Enable/disable proxy access instantly

**Business App Features**:

## üèóÔ∏è Policy Engine Architecture

### Core Policy Framework

The Ploy platform uses a sophisticated policy engine that enables dynamic rule evaluation, real-time adjustments, and complex conditional logic for loyalty program management.

#### Policy Engine Components
```typescript
interface PolicyEngine {
  rule_evaluation: {
    real_time_processing: "Sub-second policy evaluation",
    conditional_logic: "Complex if-then-else rule chains",
    context_awareness: "User, business, and environmental factors",
    dynamic_updates: "Live policy modifications without downtime"
  },
  
  policy_types: {
    earning_policies: "Point accumulation rules and multipliers",
    redemption_policies: "Spending rules and restrictions",
    tier_policies: "Membership level progression rules",
    expiration_policies: "Point lifecycle and validity rules",
    fraud_policies: "Anomaly detection and prevention rules"
  },
  
  execution_layers: {

## ‚öôÔ∏è Conditional Policies

### Dynamic Rule Engine

The conditional policy system enables businesses to create sophisticated, context-aware loyalty programs that adapt to user behavior, business conditions, and external factors.

#### Context-Aware Policy Evaluation
```typescript
interface ConditionalPolicyFramework {
  context_factors: {
    user_context: {
      loyalty_tier: "Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum tiers",
      purchase_history: "Historical transaction patterns",
      engagement_level: "Platform interaction frequency",
      referral_status: "Customer advocacy activities"
    },
    
    business_context: {
      inventory_levels: "Stock-based dynamic pricing",
      seasonal_factors: "Holiday and seasonal adjustments",
      performance_metrics: "Revenue and growth targets",
      competitive_landscape: "Market-responsive policies"
    },
    
    temporal_context: {
      time_of_day: "Peak vs off-peak reward rates",
      day_of_week: "Weekend vs weekday policies",
      seasonal_periods: "Holiday-specific rules",
      campaign_windows: "Limited-time promotional periods"
    },
    
    environmental_context: {
      location_based: "Geographic policy variations",
      weather_conditions: "Weather-responsive campaigns",
      economic_indicators: "Market-adaptive policies",
      regulatory_environment: "Compliance-driven rule adjustments"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Advanced Conditional Logic Patterns
```yaml
conditional_patterns:
  progressive_earning:
    concept: "Increasing rewards for sustained engagement"
    implementation:
      - week_1_4: "Base earning rate"
      - week_5_8: "1.2x multiplier for sustained engagement"
      - week_9_12: "1.5x multiplier for long-term loyalty"
      - week_13+: "2x multiplier for power users"
      
  purchase_velocity_bonuses:
    concept: "Reward frequent purchasing patterns"
    rules:
      - single_purchase: "1x base points"
      - 2_purchases_week: "1.25x multiplier"
      - 3_purchases_week: "1.5x multiplier"
      - 4+_purchases_week: "2x multiplier + bonus NFT"
      
  social_engagement_multipliers:

    logic:
      - high_inventory: "2x points for overstocked items"
      - normal_inventory: "1x standard point rate"
      - low_inventory: "0.5x points to preserve stock"
      - out_of_stock: "0x points + waitlist NFT reward"
```

### A/B Testing Integration
```typescript
interface ABTestingPolicies {
  experimentation_framework: {
    policy_variants: {
      control_group: "Standard 1x earning rate",
      variant_a: "1.5x earning rate with reduced redemption options",
      variant_b: "1x earning rate with premium redemption options",

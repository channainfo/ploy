## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features

### Week 6 Checkpoint - Core MVP
- Basic multi-tenant system
- Points award/revoke functionality
- Simple API endpoints
- Basic security measures

### Week 10 Checkpoint - Extended MVP
- Admin dashboard
- Fraud detection
- Integration tools
- Customer wallet interface

### Week 13 - Beta Ready
- Full feature set
- Tested & optimized
- Documentation complete
- Ready for beta users

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Blockchain complexity**: Start with testnet, use proven libraries
2. **Multi-tenant isolation**: Implement thorough testing
3. **Performance**: Design for horizontal scaling from start

### Time Risks
1. **Buffer time**: Each phase has 1-2 days buffer
2. **Parallel work**: Some modules can progress simultaneously
3. **MVP focus**: Non-critical features can be post-launch

## Success Metrics

### Development Milestones
- [ ] Smart contracts deployed to testnet (Week 2)
- [ ] First API endpoint working (Week 3)
- [ ] Multi-tenant demo ready (Week 5)
- [ ] Security audit passed (Week 7)
- [ ] Admin dashboard functional (Week 10)
- [ ] Beta user onboarded (Week 13)

### Launch Criteria
- All core features implemented

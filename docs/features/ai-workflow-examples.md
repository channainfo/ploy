# Universal LLM Workflow Examples: MCP-Powered Implementation Patterns

## Overview

This document provides practical examples of how ANY Large Language Model can interact with Ploy using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). These workflows demonstrate universal compatibility across OpenAI, Claude, Llama, and local models for managing loyalty programs conversationally.

## MCP Integration Quick Start

```bash
# Install Ploy MCP Server
npm install -g @ploy/mcp-server

# Start MCP server for your business
ploy-mcp-server --business-id=your-business --port=3001

# Connect from any MCP client (Claude Desktop, OpenAI, etc.)
# Add to your MCP client configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ploy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@ploy/mcp-server", "--business-id=your-business"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Cross-LLM Compatibility Examples

### Using with Different LLM Providers

**OpenAI GPT-4 Example:**
```javascript
// OpenAI Function Calling with Ploy MCP tools
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-turbo",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Analyze my customer segments" }],
  tools: ploy.getMCPTools(),
  tool_choice: "auto"
});
```

**Anthropic Claude Example:**
```javascript
// Claude Tool Use with MCP
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Create a loyalty campaign" }],
  tools: ploy.getMCPTools(),
  max_tokens: 4096
});
```

**Ollama Local Model Example:**
```bash
# Use with local Llama model via Ollama
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama3.1:8b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Show loyalty metrics"}],
    "tools": ["ploy_analytics", "ploy_campaigns"]
  }'
```

## üè¢ Business Owner Workflows

### Workflow 1: Morning Dashboard Review

**Scenario**: Sarah, owner of an e-commerce platform, starts her day by checking loyalty program performance using her preferred LLM.

**Works with: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Local Models**

```typescript
// Universal MCP conversation flow - same across all LLMs
User: "Good morning! How did our loyalty program perform yesterday?"

LLM Response (via MCP tools): "Good morning Sarah! Here's yesterday's performance summary:

üìä **Key Metrics (Nov 21, 2024)**
‚Ä¢ Active users: 12,847 (+8.3% vs last Tuesday)
‚Ä¢ Points awarded: 284,920 
‚Ä¢ Redemptions: 47 orders worth $4,231
‚Ä¢ New sign-ups: 193
‚Ä¢ ROI: 3.2x

üéØ **Notable Insights**:
‚Ä¢ Mobile users showed 23% higher engagement
‚Ä¢ Your 'Flash Tuesday' campaign exceeded targets by 15%
‚Ä¢ 3 high-value customers are showing churn signals

Would you like me to:
1. Deep dive into any metric
2. Show the churn-risk customers
3. Suggest optimizations for today"

User: "Show me those churn-risk customers"

AI Agent: "Here are the 3 high-value customers at risk:

1. **Emma Thompson** (ID: cust_8291)
   ‚Ä¢ Lifetime value: $3,847
   ‚Ä¢ Last purchase: 47 days ago (previously weekly)
   ‚Ä¢ Risk score: 0.84/1.0
   ‚Ä¢ Recommended action: Personal 20% win-back offer + exclusive NFT

   ‚Ä¢ Opened last 3 emails but didn't click
   ‚Ä¢ Risk score: 0.76/1.0
   ‚Ä¢ Recommended action: VIP concierge outreach

Shall I create personalized win-back campaigns for them?"

User: "Yes, create campaigns for all three with your recommendations"

AI Agent: "‚úÖ Created 3 personalized win-back campaigns:

**Campaign 1: Emma's Exclusive Return**
‚Ä¢ Sending: Personal email with 20% off + 'Loyal Legend' NFT

4. **No urgency**: Rewards have no expiration

**üéØ Optimization Recommendations**:

1. **Increase Incentives** (High Priority)
   ‚Ä¢ Referrer: $25 credit ‚Üí 2,500 points (‚âà$35 value)
   ‚Ä¢ Referee: 50% off first month + 1,000 bonus points
   ‚Ä¢ Expected impact: +150% referral rate

2. **Simplify Process** (High Priority)
   ‚Ä¢ Reduce to 2 steps: Share link ‚Üí Friend signs up
   ‚Ä¢ Add one-click sharing to dashboard
   ‚Ä¢ Auto-apply referral codes
   ‚Ä¢ Expected impact: +80% completion rate

3. **Gamification Elements** (Medium Priority)
   ‚Ä¢ Milestone rewards: 3 referrals = Exclusive 'Ambassador' NFT
   ‚Ä¢ Leaderboard: Top 10 referrers get monthly bonuses
   ‚Ä¢ Streak bonus: Extra 500 points per consecutive referral
   ‚Ä¢ Expected impact: +40% engagement

4. **Smart Triggers** (Medium Priority)
   ‚Ä¢ Show referral prompt after positive actions
   ‚Ä¢ Email campaign to power users (top 20%)
   ‚Ä¢ In-app celebration after successful referrals
   ‚Ä¢ Expected impact: +60% awareness

**üí∞ Projected Results**:
‚Ä¢ Referral rate: 2.3% ‚Üí 7.2%
‚Ä¢ Monthly referrals: 34 ‚Üí 156
‚Ä¢ Additional MRR: $10,452
‚Ä¢ ROI: 4.8x

Would you like me to:
1. Implement these changes automatically
2. Run an A/B test first
3. Create a detailed implementation plan"

User: "Let's run an A/B test with the increased incentives first"

AI Agent: "Perfect! I've set up an A/B test for the enhanced referral incentives:

**üß™ A/B Test Configuration**

**Control Group (50%)**: Current program
‚Ä¢ $10 credit for referrer
‚Ä¢ 20% off for referee

**Test Group (50%)**: Enhanced program  
‚Ä¢ 2,500 points for referrer (‚âà$35 value)
‚Ä¢ 50% off first month + 1,000 points for referee

**Test Parameters**:
‚Ä¢ Duration: 14 days
‚Ä¢ Sample size: 5,000 users per group

## üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Workflows

### Workflow 3: API Integration Assistant

**Scenario**: Alex, a developer, needs to integrate Ploy's loyalty system into their React app.

```typescript
Developer: "I need to add a points balance widget to my React app. Show me how"

AI Agent: "I'll help you add a points balance widget to your React app. Here's a complete implementation:

```tsx
// 1. Install the Ploy SDK
npm install @ploy/react-sdk

// 2. Create the PointsBalance component
import React from 'react';
import { usePloyUser, usePloyPoints } from '@ploy/react-sdk';

const PointsBalanceWidget: React.FC = () => {
  const { user, loading: userLoading } = usePloyUser();
  const { balance, history, loading: pointsLoading } = usePloyPoints(user?.id);
  
  if (userLoading || pointsLoading) {
    return <div className="points-widget loading">Loading...</div>;
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="points-widget">
      <div className="balance">
        <span className="label">Your Points</span>
        <span className="value">{balance?.available || 0}</span>
      </div>
      
      {balance?.pending > 0 && (
        <div className="pending">
          <span className="label">Pending</span>
          <span className="value">+{balance.pending}</span>
        </div>
      )}
      
      <div className="recent-activity">
        <h4>Recent Activity</h4>
        {history?.slice(0, 3).map((item) => (
          <div key={item.id} className="activity-item">
            <span>{item.description}</span>
            <span className={item.amount > 0 ? 'positive' : 'negative'}>
              {item.amount > 0 ? '+' : ''}{item.amount}
            </span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      
      <button 
        className="redeem-button"
        onClick={() => window.location.href = '/rewards'}
      >
        Redeem Points
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

// 3. Add to your app
import { PloyProvider } from '@ploy/react-sdk';

function App() {
  return (
    <PloyProvider 
      apiKey={process.env.REACT_APP_PLOY_API_KEY}
      environment="production"
    >
      <div className="app">
        <PointsBalanceWidget />
      </div>
    </PloyProvider>
  );
}

// 4. Style it (optional Tailwind example)
<style jsx>{`
  .points-widget {
    @apply bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 max-w-sm;
  }
  
  .balance {
    @apply flex justify-between items-center mb-4;
  }
  
  .balance .value {
    @apply text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600;
  }
  
  .pending {
    @apply text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4;
  }
  
  .redeem-button {
    @apply w-full bg-blue-600 text-white py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-700;
  }
`}</style>
```

**Additional Features You Can Add**:

1. **Real-time updates**:
```tsx
const { balance, subscribe } = usePloyPoints(user?.id, {
  realtime: true,
  onUpdate: (newBalance) => {
    toast.success(`You earned ${newBalance.latest} points!`);
  }
});
```

2. **Custom animations**:
```tsx
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';

<AnimatePresence>
  <motion.div
    key={balance.available}
    initial={{ scale: 1.2, color: '#10b981' }}
    animate={{ scale: 1, color: '#1e40af' }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
  >
    {balance.available}
  </motion.div>
</AnimatePresence>
```

3. **Error handling**:
```tsx
const { balance, error, retry } = usePloyPoints(user?.id, {
  onError: (err) => {
    console.error('Failed to load points:', err);
    // Fallback to cached data
    return getCachedBalance();
  }
});
```

Need help with:
1. Customizing the widget appearance
2. Adding more interactions (history, transfers)
3. Implementing server-side rendering
4. Testing the integration"

Developer: "How do I test this locally?"

AI Agent: "Here's how to test the points widget locally:

```bash
# 1. Set up local environment
cp .env.example .env.local

# Add to .env.local:
REACT_APP_PLOY_API_KEY=test_pk_abc123
REACT_APP_PLOY_ENV=sandbox
```

```tsx
// 2. Create a test wrapper for development
import { PloyProvider, MockPloyProvider } from '@ploy/react-sdk';

const TestWrapper: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
  
  if (isDev) {
    return (
      <MockPloyProvider
        mockData={{
          user: {
            id: 'test_user_123',
            email: 'test@example.com',
            tier: 'gold'
          },
          balance: {
            available: 1250,
            pending: 100,
            lifetime: 5420
          },
          history: [
            { id: '1', description: 'Purchase reward', amount: 120, date: new Date() },
            { id: '2', description: 'Referral bonus', amount: 500, date: new Date() },
            { id: '3', description: 'Redeemed reward', amount: -200, date: new Date() }
          ]
        }}
      >
        {children}
      </MockPloyProvider>
    );
  }
  
  return (
    <PloyProvider apiKey={process.env.REACT_APP_PLOY_API_KEY}>
      {children}
    </PloyProvider>
  );
};

// 3. Test different states
describe('PointsBalanceWidget', () => {
  it('displays correct balance', () => {
    render(
      <TestWrapper>
        <PointsBalanceWidget />
      </TestWrapper>
    );
    
    expect(screen.getByText('1250')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('+100')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('handles loading state', () => {
    render(
      <MockPloyProvider mockData={{ loading: true }}>
        <PointsBalanceWidget />
      </MockPloyProvider>
    );
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});

// 4. Storybook story for visual testing
export const Default = () => <PointsBalanceWidget />;
export const Loading = () => (
  <MockPloyProvider mockData={{ loading: true }}>
    <PointsBalanceWidget />
  </MockPloyProvider>
);
export const HighBalance = () => (
  <MockPloyProvider mockData={{ balance: { available: 999999 } }}>
    <PointsBalanceWidget />
  </MockPloyProvider>
);
```

**Quick Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Run your app with mock data
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test PointsBalanceWidget

# Open Storybook
npm run storybook

# Test API endpoints directly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test_pk_abc123" \
  https://api.ploy.io/v2/points/balance/test_user_123
```

The widget will now work with mock data in development and real data in production!"

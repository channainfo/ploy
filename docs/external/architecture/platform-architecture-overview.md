## ⛓️ Multi-Chain Architecture

### **Primary Chains**

#### 🔷 SUI Network (Tier 1)
- **Role**: Primary customer-facing transactions
- **Benefits**: Gas sponsorship, object-centric model, sub-second finality
- **Use Cases**: Real-time rewards, customer transactions, NFT operations

```typescript
// Example: SUI gas-sponsored transaction
module loyalty::loyalty_system {
    struct LoyaltyPoint has key, store {
        id: UID,
        value: u64,
        owner: address,
        source: String,
        timestamp: u64,
    }
    
    public fun award_points(
        user: address,
        amount: u64,
        source: String,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        let points = LoyaltyPoint {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            value: amount,
            owner: user,
            source,
            timestamp: tx_context::epoch(ctx),
        };
        
        transfer::transfer(points, user);
    }
}
```

#### 🟣 Solana Network (Tier 1)
- **Role**: High-throughput operations and bulk processing
- **Benefits**: Fee payer service, compressed NFTs, high TPS
- **Use Cases**: Bulk operations, gaming integration, DeFi protocols

```typescript
// Example: Solana compressed NFT for achievements
import { createTree, mintCompressedNft } from '@solana/spl-account-compression';

const awardAchievementNFT = async (user: PublicKey, achievement: string) => {
  const merkleTree = await createTree(connection, payer, {
    maxDepth: 14,
    maxBufferSize: 64,
  });
  
  return await mintCompressedNft(connection, payer, {
    tree: merkleTree,
    owner: user,
    metadata: {
      name: `${achievement} Achievement`,
      symbol: 'PLOY',
      uri: `https://api.ploy.io/metadata/${achievement}`,
    },
  });
};
```

#### 🔶 EVM Chains (Tier 2)
- **Role**: Enterprise integration and compatibility
- **Benefits**: Widespread adoption, tooling ecosystem
- **Use Cases**: Business integrations, cross-chain bridges

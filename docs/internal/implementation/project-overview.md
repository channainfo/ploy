## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Blockchain Complexity**
   - ✅ Start with proven libraries (OpenZeppelin)
   - ✅ Use testnet extensively
   - ✅ Include buffer time for learning

2. **Multi-Tenant Challenges**
   - ✅ Design isolation from day 1
   - ✅ Test with multiple tenants early
   - ✅ Implement thorough access controls

3. **Performance Issues**
   - ✅ Design for horizontal scaling
   - ✅ Implement caching early
   - ✅ Monitor performance continuously

### Time Management Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - ✅ Stick to defined MVP features
   - ✅ Document "nice-to-have" for post-launch
   - ✅ Regular progress reviews

2. **Learning Curve**
   - ✅ Budget extra time for new technologies
   - ✅ Start with simpler implementations
   - ✅ Iterate and improve

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - ✅ Test integrations early and often
   - ✅ Have fallback options ready
   - ✅ Use proven third-party services
